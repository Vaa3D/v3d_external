/**@file

 * making calls to Fortran routines from C++ programs. Please don't

 * is necessary.
 */

// Although we are currently triggering this off the OS, these
// really are compiler dependencies. 
//      (1) The calling convention (__stdcall for Windows)
//      (2) Name capitalization (either all-lower or all-uppercase)
//      (3) Is a trailing underscore added to the name?
//      (4) And ugliest, Fortran passes string lengths as a hidden
//          value parameter. On some compilers, that length follows
//          the string immediately. On others, all the lengths
//          appear at the end of the argument list, in the same
//          order as the strings to which they correspond.
// Point (4) requires four ugly macros to be used, two in declarations
// and two in calls to Fortran routines. One macro appears immediately
// after each string, and the other appears at the end of the argument
// list, repeated as many times as necessary. One or the other will
// evaluate to nothing.

// These macros should be used for whatever the expected default
// Fortran behavior is for whatever Fortran is typically used in
// conjunction with the current C++ compiler.
