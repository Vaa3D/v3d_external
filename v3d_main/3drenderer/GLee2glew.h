 * if try to include <QtWidgets> it will also include gl.h with QtOGL, then GLEW throws error when including glew.h,
 * because gl.h has been included before GLEW.
 * If try to include glew.h before any Qt includes, then Qt undefines all GLEW macros (except *EXT, *ARB) and get undefined symbol errors.

Qt5 seems to have set OpenGLES to a high priority than desktop openGL.
Don't think GLEW will work with the Angle based build of Qt5.

One solution to this is to build Qt5 from source code suing the setting -opengl desktop before you build. 
Something like this:  configure -debug-and-release -opengl desktop
Then use nmake to build and it works fine.

Another approach with using OpenGL extension with Qt5 is to separate all OpenGL related part from Qt class implementation.
In the Qt part just call into the framework written OpenGL code through regular C or C++ interfaces using standard types.
Since the actual OpenGL code makes no references to Qt, then it doesn't have to include Qt headers, avoiding problems.
