## This platform doesn't support automatic dependencies because we're
## not using GNU gcc.  GNU gcc is needed in order to generate the list
## of header files included by a source file.

## Since automatic dependencies are not being used, we attempt to include the
## `.distdep' file from the source tree. This file was automatically generated 
## on some system that satisfies the above requirements.
