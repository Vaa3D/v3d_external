Testing airEnums:
construct different kinds of enums, okay and broken, and use functions
on them, including airEnumUnknown

mop.c: airMopSub, airMopMem, airMopUnMem (though never used?)
 ?? airMopPrint, airMopDebug,

finish miscAir.c tests

array.c: airArrays (though used in biff, which is tested)

? threadAir.c: airThreads

754.c: airFPPartsToVal_f, airFPPartsToVal_d, airFPValToParts_d,
       airFPGen_f, airFPGen_d, airFPClass_f, airFPClass_d, airIsInf_f,
       airExists, airFPFprintf_f, airFPFprintf_d

parseAir.c: (though used as part of nrrdRead)

string.c: (though used as part of nrrdRead)

math.c: not even sure how to test most of this

? dio.c
