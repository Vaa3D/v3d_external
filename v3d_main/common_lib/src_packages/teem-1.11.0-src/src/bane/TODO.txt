lh stuff:
- limit to only going upstream or downstream
- threshold on grad mag
- threshold on distance travelled
- mirror based on 



make all the constants that GKMSInit sets be global defaults, so that
gkms can see them too.

generate string representations of inclusion strategies (unparse them),
and save these as comments in the histovolume, and save all other gkms
parameters in generated nrrds

make sure that the NUM_PARM_MAX values are correct

when 6pack filtering is in gage, support it in bane

use airMop

after regular and irregular maps are finished and debugged in nrrd,
they should be used for opacity function calculation from boundary
emphasis function control points

make new range called "baneRangeValCent" which is values conceptually
centered around some background value, which isn't necessarily zero,
and store that value in the baneRange struct itself.

the hard part:
- use gage for multi-modal data, making a 4D histogram volume
