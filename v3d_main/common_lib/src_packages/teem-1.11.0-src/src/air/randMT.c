  Mersenne Twister random number generator -- a C++ class MTRand
  Based on code by Makoto Matsumoto, Takuji Nishimura, and Shawn Cokus
  Richard J. Wagner  v1.0  15 May 2003  rjwagner@writeme.com

  The Mersenne Twister is an algorithm for generating random numbers.  It
  was designed with consideration of the flaws in various other generators.
  The period, 2^19937-1, and the order of equidistribution, 623 dimensions,
  are far greater.  The generator is also fast; it avoids multiplication and
  division, and it benefits from caches and pipelines.  For more information
  see the inventors' web page at http://www.math.keio.ac.jp/~matumoto/emt.html
