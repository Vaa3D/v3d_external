enhex/dehex
-----------

enhex and dehex are a stand-alone hex encoder/decoder pair.
They convert between data in raw form (paying no regard to the
endianness), and convert it to hexadecimal form.  

To compile:

  cc -o enhex enhex.c
  cc -o dehex dehex.c

I wrote these programs for doing the hex encoding which is an optional
encoding in the nrrd library in Teem.  The (convoluted) reason is that
the only encodings that are *required* of non-Teem nrrd readers and
writers are raw and ascii.  All other encodings should be able to be
handled by stand-alone tools (such as gzip/gunzip for zlib
compression, and bzip/bunzip2 for bzip compress).  Yet, a google
search didn't reveal simple tools for raw--hex conversion, so I wrote
them.  Nothing fancy.
