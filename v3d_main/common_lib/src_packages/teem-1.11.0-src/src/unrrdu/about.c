    "\"unu\" is a command-line interface to much of the functionality "

    "library in the \"Teem\" collection of libraries.  More information "
    "about Teem is at <http://teem.sf.net>. A checkout of Teem source "
    "is available via:\n "

    "Long-term maintenance of this software depends on funding, and "
    "funding depends on being able to document who is using it for what.  "
    "If unu or Nrrd has helped in your research, including for simple one-off "
    "experiments or mundane data hacking, the developers of Teem would love "
    "to know. There are multiple ways of communicating this.  "
    "In your publications, consider adding a line such as this "
    "in the Acknowledgments: "
    "\"Data processing performed with the unu tool, "
    "part of the Teem toolkit available at "
    "http://teem.sf.net\". "
    "Alternatively, please email glk@uchicago.edu and briefly describe "
    "how Teem software has helped in your work. "
    "Please also consider joining the teem-users mailing list: "
    "<http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/teem-users>. This is "
    "the primary forum for feedback, questions, and feature requests.\n ";

    "A summary list of unu commands is generated by running simply \"unu\". "
    "Running a unu command without additional arguments "
    "(e.g. \"unu slice\") generates its description and usage information. "
    "This includes information (marked with \"* Uses ...\") "
    "about the underling Nrrd library calls "
    "(e.g. nrrdSlice()) that implement the basic functionality in "
    "that unu command.\n ";
  char par4[] = "\t\t\t\t"
    "The utility of unu is mainly as a pre-processing tool for getting "
    "data into a type, encoding, format, or dimensions best suited for some "
    "visualization or rendering task.  Also, slices and projections are "
    "effective ways to visually inspect the contents of a dataset. "
    "Especially useful commands include make, resample, crop, slice, "
    "project, histo, dhisto, quantize, and save. Unu can process "
    "CT and MRI volume datasets, grayscale and color images, "
    "time-varying volumes of vector fields (5-D arrays), and more. "
    "Currently supported formats are plain text files (2-D float arrays), "
    "NRRD, VTK structured points, and PNG and PNM images.  "
    "\"unu make -bs -1\" can read from most DICOM files.  "
    "\"unu save\" can generate EPS files. "
    "Supported encodings are raw, ascii, hex, gzip, and bzip2.\n";
  char par5[] = "\t\t\t\t"
    "Much of the functionality of unu derives from chaining multiple "
    "invocations together with pipes (\"|\"), minimizing the "
    "need to save out intermediate files. For example, if "
    "\"data.raw.gz\" is a gzip'ed 256\tx\t256\tx\t80 volume of raw floats "
    "written from a PC, "
    "then the following will save to \"zsum.png\" a histogram "
    "equalized summation projection along the slowest axis:\n";
