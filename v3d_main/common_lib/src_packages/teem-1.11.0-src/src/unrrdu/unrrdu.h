/*
** UNRRDU_DECLARE, UNRRDU_LIST, UNRRDU_MAP
**
** Twisted C-preprocessor tricks.  The idea is to make it as simple
** as possible to add new commands to unu, so that the new commands
** have to be added to only one thing in this source file, and
** the Makefile.
**
** Associated with each unu command are some pieces of information:
** the single word command (e.g. "slice") that is used by invoke it,
** the short (approx. one-line) description of its function, and the
** "main" function to call with the appropriate argc, argv.  It would
** be nice to use a struct to hold this information, and we can: the
** unrrduCmd struct is defined above.  It would also be nice to have
** all the command's information be held in one array of unrrduCmds.
** Unfortunately, declaring this is not possible unless all the
** unrrduCmds and their fields are IN THIS FILE, because otherwise
** they're not constant expressions, so they can't initialize an
** aggregate data type.  So, we instead make an array of unrrduCmd
** POINTERS, which can be initialized with the addresses of individual
** unrrduCmd structs, declared and defined in the global scope. is
** done in flotsam.c.  Each of the source files for the various unu
** commands are responsible for setting the fields (at compile-time)
** of their associated unrrduCmd.
**
** We use three macros to automate this somewhat:
** UNRRDU_DECLARE: declares unrrdu_xxxCmd as an extern unrrduCmd
**                 (defined in xxx.c), used later in this header file.
** UNRRDU_LIST:    the address of unrrdu_xxxCmd, for listing in the array of
**                 unrrduCmd structs in the (compile-time) definition of
**                 unrrduCmdList[].  This is used in flotsam.c.
**
** Then, to facilitate running these macros on each of the different
** commands, there is a UNRRDU_MAP macro which is used to essentially map
** the two macros above over the list of unu commands.  Functional
** programming meets the C pre-processor.  Therefore:
***********************************************************
    You add commands to unu by:
    1) adjusting the definition of UNRRDU_MAP()
    2) listing the appropriate object in GNUmakefile and sources.cmake
    That's it.
