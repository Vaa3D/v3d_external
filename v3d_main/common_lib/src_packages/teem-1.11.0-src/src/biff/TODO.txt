[gnocchi:~/Deft/src] gk% vprobe -i crop.nhdr -k tensor -q hess -s 1 1 1 -o hess.nrrd
gageKindTotalAnswerLength: PANIC:
 [gage] gageKindCheck: kind "tensor" item max 65 > GAGE_ITEM_MAX 63


*** fix memory-in-use problem after a biffGetDone()

biffDisable()

allow more flexibility in logging- not just strings, but ints, or both
make this all thread safe- the "keys" that are used should somehow
 be make specific to a given thread,
 or at least this specificity should be enabled at caller's request
