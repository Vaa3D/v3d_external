Help for HDF5 Makefiles
For help with the make utility itself, try 'man make'.

HDF5 makefiles are used to build, test, and install HDF5.  The exact
behavior and output will depend on your system's version of make, compiler,
etc.

Usage: make [make options] [TARGET]

Targets:
make help:		print this help message

make, make all:         (default if no target is specified)
                        builds all libraries, tools, and tests
make lib:               builds libraries only
make progs:             builds libraries and programs
make tests:             builds libraries, programs, and tests.
                        Essentially the same as 'make all'.
make check, make tests,
make _test, make test:  Run HDF5's test suite.
                        Make will exit with a failure if any tests fail.

make install:           install HDF5 libraries, include files, and tools
make install-examples:  installs example source files
make install-all:       runs both make-install and make install-examples
make check-install:     test building examples with installed HDF5 library
make uninstall:         remove installed files
make install-examples:  removes example source files
make uninstall-all:     removes both installed libraries and examples

make check-clean:       remove files generated by running tests
                        (allows tests to be re-run)
make mostlyclean:       remove intermediate files (*.o files).
                        Doesn't clean libraries or executables.
make clean:             remove all files generated by make or make check
make distclean:         remove all files generated by make, make check, or
                        configure

make check-p:           Only run parallel tests
make check-s:           Only run serial tests
make check-vfd:         Run tests with each virtual file driver

HDF5 uses Automake, so any standard Automake targets not listed here
should also work.

Configure options that affect Makefile behavior:
        --enable-fortran, --enable-cxx, --enable-parallel, and --disable-hl
enable or disable various interfaces.  Make will only recurse into these
directories if they are specified at configure time.
        --prefix=[path], --libdir=[path], --includedir=[path], etc. can be used
to change the directory into which make install puts files.
        --enable-build-all causes make to build some files that are only
needed by developers (test file generation programs).

Environment variables that affect Makefile behavior:
        Make will honor environment variables like CFLAGS that are used when building and linking.
        The variable HDF5TestExpress can be used to control the running time
of the tests.  HDF5TestExpress = 0 is a full run of the tests while
to run make check.  1 and 2 are intermediate values.  The default value is 1.

Available command-line options for make depend on the version of make installed
on your system.  Try 'man make'.
