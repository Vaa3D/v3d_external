** 2) regardless of the centerings of the axes of nxtf, the lookup table
** axes will be treated as though they were cell centered (linear

** 3) the logical dimension of the transfer function is always one less
** ntxf->dim, with axis 0 always for the range of the function, and axes
** 1 and onwards for the domain.  For instance, a univariate opacity map
** is 2D, with ntxf->axis[0].size == 1.
