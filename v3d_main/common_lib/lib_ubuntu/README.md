# Tips
QT6 only works on **Ubuntu 20**
you will need to install the libs as follows:  
sudo apt install build-essential  
sudo apt install mesa-common-dev  
sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-dev   
sudo apt install libglu1-mesa-dev   
sudo apt install freeglut3-dev  
sudo apt install libhdf5-dev  
you may ignore the operations above if you already installed them.
