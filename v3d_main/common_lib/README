The 3rd party library files were provided here only for convenience. These packages should be downloaded 
from the respective websites directly, except libtiff, which was changed a little bit so that it can be
used to read Zeiss LSM file.

The two not-really-needed libraries fftw and gsl are standard. They are kept here for convenience.

The newmat11 library is necessary.

The boost library is also necessary.

When compile fftw libraries, two versions for both single-precision (float) and double-precision (double) 
numbers need to be generated. So it needs to be configure twice and make and make install twice.
