Main features

- designed for very large images (TeraByte-sized or more)
- fast and reliable 3D stitching based on a multi-MIP approach
- typical memory requirement <8 GigaBytes
- 2D stitching also supported (experimental)
- support for image files bigger than 2 GB
- regular expression based matching for image file names
- data subset selection
- sparse data support 
- i/o plugin-based architecture
- stop and resume the last step of stitching (merge)
