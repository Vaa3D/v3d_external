Windows 7, QT 4.6 32/64bit compiling.

If you see the problem "QMAKESPEC has not been set, so configuration cannot be deduced", this may be solved by
checking the file under qt directory "qt.conf" (e.g. under the folder C:\Qt\4.6.2_x64\bin). You need to check the
variable "Prefix"'s value, and ensure such a value is the same of the Qt program folder's name, and also
such a name is in Windows system path.
