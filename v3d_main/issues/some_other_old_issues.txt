* 100517: for ubuntu configure of qt, need "sudo apt-get build-dep qt4-qmake". 

* 090130: fo Wayne's Ubuntu, the GLU is missing and I run "sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev" and then redo the QT make. 

* 090130: for Wayne's Ubuntu, it seems OpenGL is missing thus the compiling of V3D encounters problems. Running "sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev" for OpenGL and re-do the make of QT (maybe because OPenGL was missing thus the default QT 'configure -opengl' was disabled automatically.) Also note that before I do this, even a "qtdemo" will produce a "Floating point exception".   

* 090129: for Wayne's Ubuntu, there is a QT make error saying "error: X11/Xlib.h: No such file or directory".... This is because Ubuntu has no X11 dev installed. This can be fixed by running "sudo apt-get install libx11-dev" and "sudo apt-get install xorg-dev" and re-make.

* 090115: for Wayne's Ubuntu, initially there is no GCC. This can be fixed by running "sudo apt-get install build-essential"

* 081007: for Maci and Tiger of Simpson lab machine (7300GT video card), for v3d build should use "qmake v3d.pro DEFINES+=MACI_TIGER". Then rebuild everything.

* 080926: upgrade to v3d_2.0 folder

* 080925: for different OSs, use different build.mac (for mac) or build.msys (for windows) to generate the executables.

* 080923: use build.msys to build the windows version. Note that MingW mingw32-make.exe should be copied to another file "make.exe" so that to avoid compilation error. Also build.msys can be follolwed by "release", "debug" or "clean" to generate different versions.
